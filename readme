This project is about creating something similar to Handler class in Android.
Handler allows to build event based systems.
To use the framework do the following:
1. create portmacro.h which contains macros for enabling and disabling interrupts
2. create port.c which contains some timer setups
3. create main.c which looks like that:
    while(1)
    {
        MsgQueue_processNextMessage( &mainQueue );
    }
4. Profit!

Have fun!
